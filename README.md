# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest classifier, trained on a well-known, real-world dataset. It demonstrates how machine-learning models can be built, evaluated, and deployed as a production-style API — all while keeping the architecture simple, efficient, and industry-aligned.

⭐ Key Highlights

Built an end-to-end fraud detection system using real transaction data.

Used the Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and strong performance on imbalanced, tabular datasets.

Addressed real-world risks by focusing on precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, ensuring the model handles rare fraud cases effectively.

Incorporated class imbalance strategies (such as class weighting and proper splitting) to improve minority-class performance.

Packaged the trained model and deployed it with a FastAPI backend, enabling real-time predictions.

Dockerized the entire application to ensure portability, scalability, and smooth deployment across environments.

📂 What This Project Demonstrates

Practical ML workflow: data loading → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → saving the model.

Best practices for handling imbalanced datasets in fraud-detection scenarios.

Realistic backend deployment using FastAPI with a clean prediction API endpoint.

Containerized ML inference using Docker for easy production simulation.

Industry-ready design suitable for portfolios, LinkedIn showcases, and internship/job applications.
